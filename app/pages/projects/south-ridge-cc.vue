  challenge:
    "South Ridge Community Church needed a professional-grade live production system to support their growing congregation and expanding online ministry. Their existing setup was inadequate for multi-campus streaming and lacked the reliability needed for weekly worship services.",
  outcomes:

  solution:
    "We implemented a complete live production system featuring multi-camera setup with professional PTZ cameras, digital mixing console with scene recall, broadcast-quality livestreaming infrastructure, and integrated media playback systems. The system was designed for volunteer operation with extensive training and documentation.",
  results: [
    "Professional-quality livestreaming to multiple campuses",
    "Increased online engagement with remote worshippers",
    "Volunteer teams operating systems confidently after training",
    "Reliable production for weekly services and special events",
    "Scalable infrastructure for future campus expansion",
