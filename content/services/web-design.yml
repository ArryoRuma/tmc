    description:
      Most company websites look polished but fail at their core job, turning interest into action.
      They act like digital brochures instead of revenue assets—disconnected from sales, unclear on who they serve,
      and silent when buyers are ready to decide. These are the most common points of failure we see in company websites.

    title: What's Required for a Website to Actually Drive Revenue
    description: >
      A website only drives revenue when it supports how buyers evaluate options,
      build confidence, and take next steps.
      That requires clear positioning, intentional page structure,
      and tight alignment with sales and marketing workflows.
      Our web design approach is built to do exactly that.
    features:
      - title: Clear Positioning & Buyer-Focused Messaging
        description: >
          Your site clearly communicates who it's for, what problem you solve,
          and why you're the right choice—above the fold and throughout the journey.

      - title: Conversion-Driven Page Structure
        description: >
          Pages are intentionally laid out to guide visitors from interest to action,

          and downstream revenue impact.

      - title: Fast Updates Without Developer Bottlenecks
        description:
          &gt; Content, messaging, and offers can be updated quickly without breaking layouts
          or relying on long dev cycles.
