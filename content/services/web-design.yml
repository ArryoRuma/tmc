    description: >
      Most company websites look polished but fail at their core job, turning interest into action.
      They act like digital brochures instead of revenue assets—disconnected from sales, unclear on who they serve,
      and silent when buyers are ready to decide. These are the most common points of failure we see in company websites.

    title: What's Required for a Website to Actually Drive Revenue

      A website only drives revenue when it supports how buyers evaluate options,
      build confidence, and take next steps.

faq:
  title: Frequently Asked Questions
  headline: Common Questions About Our Web Design Process
  description: >
    We work with businesses to turn their websites into revenue-generating assets.
    Here are answers to the most common questions we hear during vendor evaluation.
  items:
    - label: What does the Website Growth System include?
      content: >
        The Website Growth System includes: (1) Messaging & Positioning Workshop to clarify
        your value proposition, (2) Buyer-Centric Site Architecture mapped to how your customers
        actually evaluate and buy, (3) Strategic Website Design & Development focused on clarity
        and conversion, (4) Copywriting Support to ensure messaging is clear and compelling,
        (5) On-Page SEO optimization, (6) Analytics & Form Setup, (7) CRM Integration, and
        (8) Post-Launch Support & Training. Everything is designed to turn your website into
        an active part of your sales and marketing system.

    - label: Who writes the copy for the website?
      content: >
        We provide strategic copywriting support as part of every engagement. During the messaging
        workshop, we work with you to clarify positioning, value propositions, and buyer language.
        From there, we draft page copy based on that foundation. You review and refine to ensure
        accuracy and voice alignment. If you prefer to write internally or already have copy, we'll
        work with what you have and provide structural guidance.

    - label: What's the timeline and what can delay it?
      content: >
        Most projects complete in 4-8 weeks from kickoff to launch, with 6 weeks being the average.
        Timeline depends on: (1) Content readiness (existing copy, images, case studies),
        (2) Stakeholder alignment (decision-making speed, number of reviewers), and
        (3) Integration complexity (CRM, third-party tools). The biggest delays come from internal
        review cycles and waiting on client-provided assets. We'll set clear milestones and
        keep you on track.

    - label: Do we own the site, files, and logins after launch?
      content: >
        Yes. You own everything. After launch, we transfer full ownership of the website, all design
        files, code, content, and admin credentials. There are no proprietary locks or dependencies
        that require you to stay with us. We can provide ongoing support and optimization if you'd like,
        but it's never required.

    - label: What platform is the site built on and why?
      content: >
        We build most B2B service websites on modern platforms like Webflow, WordPress (with custom themes),
        or Nuxt/Vue.js depending on your needs. Platform choice is based on: (1) Your internal team's technical
        comfort, (2) Integration requirements (CRM, marketing automation), and (3) Long-term flexibility and
        performance needs. We'll recommend the best fit during discovery and explain the tradeoffs clearly.

    - label: How do you handle SEO and analytics?
      content: >
        Every site is built with technical SEO best practices: proper heading hierarchy, meta tags, alt text,
        XML sitemaps, schema markup, and mobile optimization. We also set up Google Analytics 4, Google Search
        Console, and goal tracking so you can measure performance. SEO isn't an add-on—it's baked into the
        structure from day one. If you want ongoing content strategy or link building, we offer that separately.

    - label: What does maintenance look like after launch?
      content: >
        Post-launch, you can handle updates yourself (we train you), bring us in as needed for changes,
        or opt into a monthly maintenance plan. Maintenance typically includes: software/plugin updates,
        security monitoring, uptime monitoring, minor content edits, and performance optimization. Plans
        start at $350/month. It's optional—you're never locked in.

    - label: Can you work with internal stakeholders or compliance teams?
      content: >
        Absolutely. We regularly work with legal, compliance, marketing, and sales teams to ensure messaging
        is accurate, compliant, and aligned with internal processes. We'll accommodate review cycles, approvals,
        and revisions as part of the process. Clear stakeholder alignment actually speeds up projects—we'll
        help you structure that upfront.

    - label: What happens if we need changes after launch?
      content: >
        All packages include post-launch support (30, 60, or 90 days depending on package). During this period,
        we handle bug fixes, minor content updates, and optimization tweaks at no extra cost. After that, you can
        make updates yourself, request changes as needed (billed hourly), or opt into a maintenance plan for
        ongoing support.

    - label: How is this different from hiring a traditional web design agency?
      content: >
        Most agencies focus on aesthetics and delivering a "website" as a project. We focus on revenue outcomes.
        Our outcomes integrates messaging strategy, buyer psychology, sales enablement, and conversion optimization—not
        just design. We treat the website as a system that supports your entire go-to-market motion, not a one-time
        deliverable. You'll see the difference in how sales uses the site and how qualified your inbound leads become.

        Our new website cut our sales cycle by almost a third. Prospects now show up to calls
        already understanding our process and pricing—we're spending more time closing deals
        and less time educating.

        We went from 3-4 qualified leads per month to 12-15, and the quality is noticeably better.
        The messaging workshop alone was worth the investment—it changed how we talk about our services everywhere.

        Sales finally uses our website during deals. We can send prospects to specific pages that
        address their exact objections instead of writing custom emails every time. It's become
        a real sales tool, not just marketing collateral.
