# Artifact 1 — Positioning Document (`docs/positioning.md`)

## One‑Line Positioning

TruMedia Creative helps industrial and professional‑services companies turn complex expertise into sales‑ready proof and predictable pipeline using video‑led systems.

## Who This Is For (Primary ICP)

- Founder‑led or sales‑led B2B companies
- Industrial, manufacturing, logistics, financial, and expert‑services firms
- High trust sales cycles with long consideration windows

## Who This Is *Not* For

- Low‑ticket ecommerce
- Influencer or brand‑awareness‑only campaigns
- Businesses without a clear sales motion

## Core Problems We Solve

- Buyers do not understand the value quickly
- Sales cycles stall due to unanswered objections
- Marketing assets exist but are not used by sales

## Primary Value Pillars

1. **Clarity** — Clear messaging buyers understand in seconds
2. **Proof** — Case studies and FAQs that reduce risk
3. **Distribution** — Outreach systems that get assets seen

## Competitive Frame

We are not a video production company. We are not a general marketing agency. We are a video‑led revenue system partner.
