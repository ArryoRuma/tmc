# TruMedia Creative Website — Execution Roadmap

This roadmap is designed as a **build-and-operate system**, not a finish-line checklist. It is organized by phases, each with a clear objective, concrete work, durable artifacts, and explicit exit criteria so you always know what to do next.

---

## Phase 0 — Strategic Guardrails (Lock Before You Build)

**Objective**

Eliminate rework and scope drift by freezing the decisions that everything else depends on.

### Inputs

- [X] Positioning statement
- [X] ICP tiers (Primary / Secondary / Tertiary)
- [ ] Core revenue motions (Video → Outreach → Retainers)
- [ ] Explicit non-goals (what the site is _not_ responsible for)

### Work

- [X] Define **primary CTA per audience**
  - [X] Cold traffic → Strategy Call
  - [X] Warm traffic → Package / Offer pages
  - [X] Existing clients → Resources / Docs
- [X] Define **conversion hierarchy**
  - [X] Hero CTA
  - [X] Inline CTAs
  - [X] Exit-intent or last-chance CTAs
- [X] Lock **success metrics**
  - [X] Macro: booked calls, qualified leads
  - [X] Micro: scroll depth, video plays, CTA clicks

### Artifacts Produced

- [X] `docs/positioning.md`
- [X] `docs/cta-map.yml`
- [X] `docs/metrics.yml`

**Exit Criteria**

You can answer "what should this page make someone do?" in one sentence.

**Exit Criteria**

You stop tweaking spacing, fonts, and animations mid-build.

---

## Phase 4 — Revenue Pages (Money First)

---

## Phase 7 — Iteration & Scale

**Objective**

Turn the site into an asset, not a recurring project.

### Ongoing Cadence

- [ ] Weekly: friction log
- [ ] Monthly: page-level optimizations
- [ ] Quarterly: offer and positioning review

### Backlog Themes

**Exit Criteria**

Changes are incremental, intentional, and revenue-driven.

---

## Operating Note

Treat this document as a living system. Each phase should be marked:

- [ ] Not Started
- [ ] In Progress
- [ ] Locked

Once a phase is locked, changes require intent—not impulse.
